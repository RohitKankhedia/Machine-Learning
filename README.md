In this blog we will be looking at very small example of machine learning in order to understand how it work,



we have data set as per below table which have home price bases on area. 


area	price
2600	550000
3000	565000
3200	610000
3600	680000
4000	725000

Now , basis on this table we need to find the price of home if the area is 3200 and 5000 .

Remember we don`t have the formula as here we will be doing this with only existing data to understand ML





Thanks ,

Rohit
